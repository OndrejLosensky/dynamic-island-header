# Dynamic Header

**Simple web application made with React.js styled with TailwindCSS. Instead of clasical header I have created this one that looks like Apple's dynamic island on new iPhones. It expands when user hovers over it and displays additional information or controls.**

## Installation
*You can easily implement this into your project by coyping the component and then just styling the whole component with given options*
```bash
<div className="pt-4 sticky top-0 z-10 ">
    <DynamicIsland/>
</div>
```
